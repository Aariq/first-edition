A Practical Guide to the Integral Projection Model} 

\maketitle

\paragraph{Section 2.3:} We think that the statement about ``piecewise continuous'' in the footnote is true, but at least one proof in the book isn't valid regardless of what the curves are that divide $\Z^2$ into subregions. A slightly less general definition, which should be sufficient for any applications, is as follows. For the basic
model where the individual-level state space $\Z$ is a 
bounded interval $[L,U]$, a partition of $\Z$ is a set of 
intervals 
\begin{equation}
\Z_1 = (z_0,z_1), \Z_2 = (z_1,z_2), \cdots, \Z_m = (z_{m-1},z_m) 
\end{equation}
where 
\be
L=z_0 < z_1 < z_2 < \cdots < z_M=U. 
\ee
A partition breaks $\Z^2$ into a set of open rectangles 
$$\Z_{ij} = \Z_i \times \Z_j = \{(z',z): z' \in \Z_i, z \in \Z_j\}.$$
Define the kernels $K_{ij}$ to be $K$ restricted to $\Z_{ij}$. 

We say that $K$ is \emph{piecewise continuous} if there exists a 
partition such that each of the kernels $K_{ij}$ is continuous on $\Z_{ij}$, 
and can be defined on the boundary of $\Z_{ij}$ so that it is continuous
on the closed rectangle $\bar{\Z}_{ij}$ consisting of $\Z_{ij}$ and its boundary.  

The reason this definition works is the general theory in Chapter 6
(originally in the Appendices to \citet{ellner-rees-2006}) applied to the  
closed intervals $\bar{\Z}_{i} =  [z_0,z_1]$ as a set of continuous components, 
with continuous component-to-component kernels $K_{ij}$. There are then state distribution 
functions $n_i(z,t)$ defined on each $\bar{\Z}_i$, and in terms of the general     
theory, this is an IPM with continuous kernels. But we can also think of it as defining a 
single distribution function $n(z,t)$ on all of $[L,U]$, consisting of $n_1,n_2, \cdots n_M$ 
side-by-side. 

Each of the points $z_i$ is in two adjacent components, but this doesn't matter because  
single points contribute nothing to the 
As an example consider  $\Z = [0,2]$ and the (nonsensical) kernel $K(z',z) = 1$ 
if $z'>1$, and 0 otherwise. The partition is $\Z_1 = (0,1), \Z_2 = (1,2)$ and the kernels are 
\be
K_{11}=K_{12}\equiv 0, K_{21}=K_{22}\equiv 1.
\ee
The population dynamics are 
\ba
n_1(z',t+1) & = \int_0^1 K_{11}(z',z) n_1(z,t) dz + \int_1^2 K_{12}(z',z) n_2(z,t) dz  = 0 \\
n_2(z',t+1) & = \int_0^1 K_{21}(z',z) n_1(z,t) dz + \int_1^2 K_{22}(z',z) n_2(z,t) dz  \\
& =  \int_0^1 n_1(z,t) dz + \int_1^2 n_2(z,t) dz.  
\label{eqn:badK1}
\ea
So $n_1(1,t+1)=0$, while $n_2(1,t+1)>0$ unless there were no individuals at time $t$. 
However, the values of $n_1$ and $n_2$ at the one point $z=1$ have no effect on the
integrals in the population dynamics, so we can regard $n(1,t+1)$ as being undefined,
or give it an arbitrary value such the average $n_1(1,t+1)$ and $n_2(1,t+1)$. 

The contrived kernel is \eqref{eqn:badK1} a counter-example to the claim in section 6.9 that a 
piecewise continuous kernel, as defined in that section, maps $L_1(\Z)$ into $C(\Z)$. 
The gap in the proof is the assertion that the functions $f_n$ converge almost everywhere, 
which is not necessarily true regardless of how the partitioning into sets $\mathcal{U}_k$ is done. But on the 
set of domains $\bar{\Z}_{i}$ the component kernels are all continuous and the $f_n$ converge 
pointwise, which is sufficient for the rest of the proof. 
In example \eqref{eqn:badK1}, $n_1$ is continuous on $\bar{\Z}_1$ and 
$n_2$ is continuous on $\bar{\Z}_2$, and that is exactly what it means to be continuous
on the state space with domains $\bar{\Z}_1$ and $\bar{\Z}_2$.
